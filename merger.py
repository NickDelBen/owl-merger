# For combining and merging grades to an OWL uploadable zip file
#
# Instructions for use:
#   1. Each marker should download the folder with attached feedback comments text file
#         Do not include students without submissions!
#   2. For each question marked a line in comments.txt file in the students folder should be created:
#         Q1(a): 17/20 Missing details on the description
#         Q1(b): 10/10 
#         Q2: 0/5 Not sure what you were doing here
#      The format is obvious from the above examples I hope
#   3. The generated archive should be uplaoded to OWL with the following options selected
#         - Grade file (AND CSV)
#         - Feedback comments
#   This will upload the merged comments and grades to OWL
#
# Parameters
#     <mark_csv_file>   CSV Grade File download from OWL
#     <output_zip_path> Path for generated zip archive to be uploaded to OWL
#     <comment_folders> one or more paths of the student grade folders to be merged
